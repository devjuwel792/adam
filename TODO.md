# TODO: Create Login Page Route

## Information Gathered
- Router file (src/router/Routes.jsx) contains existing routes, including "/admin" for AdminDashboard.
- LoginPage component already exists at src/Admin/Login/index.jsx with a basic login form UI.

## Plan
- [x] Import LoginPage component in src/router/Routes.jsx.
- [x] Add a new route "/admin/login" that renders the LoginPage component.
- [ ] Test the route by navigating to /admin/login in the browser to ensure it renders correctly.

## Dependent Files to be Edited
- src/router/Routes.jsx: Added import and route definition.

## Followup Steps
- Launch browser and navigate to http://localhost:5174/admin/login to verify the login page displays.
- Check for any console errors or rendering issues.
