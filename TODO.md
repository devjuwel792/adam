# TODO: Integrate Profile Data into ProfessionalComparison.jsx

- [x] Update years of experience in statistics section to use profile?.years_of_experience instead of hardcoded 3.2
- [x] Add speciality to the profile header (e.g., display "Blood Collection" next to role)
- [x] Add service area and work preferable to the credentials section
- [ ] Add a new "Weekly Availability" section to display the weekly_schedule array
